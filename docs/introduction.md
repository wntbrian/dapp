Dapp helps implement and support Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).

With dapp, DevOps engineers generate and deploy images by linking together:

- application code (with Git support),
- infrastructure code (with Ansible or shell scripts), and
- platform as a service (Kubernetes).

Dapp simplifies development of build scripts, reduces commit build time and automates deployment.
It is designed to make engineer's work fast end efficient.


## Features

* Reducing average build time.
* Sharing a common cache between builds.
* Running distributed builds with common registry.
* Reducing image size by detaching source data and build tools.
* Building images with Ansible or shell scripts.
* Building multiple images from one description.
* Advanced tools for debugging built images.
* Deploying to Kubernetes via [helm](https://helm.sh/), the Kubernetes package manager.
* Tools for cleaning both local and remote Docker registry caches.
