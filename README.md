___

Dapp is made to implement and support Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).

It helps DevOps engineers generate and deploy images by linking together:

- application code (with Git support),
- infrastructure code (with Ansible or shell scripts), and
- platform as a service (Kubernetes).

Dapp simplifies development of build scripts, reduces commit build time and automates deployment.
It is designed to make engineer's work fast end efficient.
